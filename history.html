    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>
        The name "Corte Madera," which means "Cut Wood," is often thought to be connected to redwood logging for the Presidio or San Francisco, but that’s not actually true. The name goes back to 1776 when Spanish soldiers gathered small trees and driftwood from a stream near what is now Mill Valley, called Arroyo Corte Madera. Later, in 1834, John Reed received a land grant in the area and set up a sawmill, but it didn’t last long. The Reed family had a long fight to prove they owned the land, finally winning their case in 1885. While there was redwood logging in other parts of Marin, Corte Madera didn’t have many redwood forests. The name was used by early settlers and was officially restored by the 1890s, but it’s really more about gathering firewood than cutting down huge redwoods.
